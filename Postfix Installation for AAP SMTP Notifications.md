## Add Gmail Username and Password to Postfix

Open or create the ```/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd``` file and add the SMTP Host, username, and password information:
```
[smtp.gmail.com]:587 <youremail@gmail.com>:<yourgmailpassword>  
``` 

### For password without 2FA (Not recommended)
Just enter the password as it is in ```/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd/```

### For password with 2FA (Recommended)

1. Go to Google and sign in with your Gmail account.
2. Click on your profile present on right upper side corner.
3. Click on 'Manage your Google Account'.
4. On the left pane, select 'Security'.
5. Scroll down to 'Signing in to Google' section.
6. In that, assuming you have 2FA activated, click on 'App passwords'.
7. In 'Select App', select 'Other' and give name as 'Postfix' and click on 'GENERATE'.
8. The new app password will be generated. It will be shown for once so copy it and use it for 'sasl_passwd'.

Save it and create the hash db file for Postfix by running the postmap command:
```
sudo postmap /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
```
Secure Your Postfix Hash Database and Email Password Files:
```
sudo chown root:root /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd.db
```
```
sudo chmod 0600 /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd.db
```
